# Churn-Classification\

\
In this project I compared different classification algorithms (Pipeline-comparisons file) with different type of data preprocessing methods and taking into account the time of all those processes. Selected model is then evaluating, optimizing and data dependences are checked in a Explanatory_Analysis-interpretation file.
