# Churn-Classification
---
  
In this project I compared different classification algorithms (Pipeline-comparisons file) with different type of data preprocessing methods and taking into account the time of all those processes. Selected model is then evaluating, optimizing and data dependences are checked in a Explanatory_Analysis-interpretation file. Originally interactive plotly plots using dalex library have been used, but to display it here their static versions have been provided.

I found dataset on kaggle, but originally dataset was uploaded on: https://zenodo.org/record/4322342#.ZBtsb3bMK5d. Csv file is also included here.  
Model explanations were done using dalex library.
